# odin-recipes
This is my first HTML project in the odin project programme. It will create a website of different recipes with links together. 

## Skills I will demonstrate
By the end of this project, I will demonstrate basic HTML skills, like how to create tags, including those with attributes, how to link pages together and insert images, how to organize files, and more.
